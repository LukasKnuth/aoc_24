# Day 4: Ceres Search

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:kino, "~> 0.14.0"}
], consolidate_protocols: false)
# NOTE: disable consolidation of protocols to allow the new protocol for WordMatrix
# to be defined _after_ compilation.
```

## Reading

* **Input**: a word search
* Look for word `XMAS`
* The word can be written
  * backwards
  * horizontal
  * vertical
  * diagonal
  * overlapping other words (I understand this to mean that words that are used once to make an `XMAS` are NOT struc from the list and can be used to make another `XMAS`)
* Count _all_ occourences

First off, this Elf that does a word search like the one in the input data is insane. Send her help as soon as possible.

## Input

The file `day4_input.bin`, downloaded and stored as an attachment to this livebook.

```elixir
defmodule WordMatrix do
  defstruct matrix: [], rows: 0, cols: 0
  def new(matrix) do
    rows = length(matrix)
    cols = matrix |> Enum.at(0) |> length()
    %__MODULE__{matrix: matrix, rows: rows, cols: cols}
  end
end

word_matrix =
  Kino.FS.file_path("day4_input.bin")
  |> File.stream!()
  |> Stream.map(fn line -> line |> String.trim_trailing() |> String.to_charlist() end)
  |> Enum.to_list()
  |> WordMatrix.new()
```

## Idea

```elixir
defimpl Enumerable, for: WordMatrix do
  @window_length 4
  
  @impl true
  def count(%WordMatrix{cols: cols, rows: rows}) do
    {:ok, (cols - (@window_length - 1)) * (rows - (@window_length - 1))}
  end

  @impl true
  def reduce(_wm, {:suspend, _}, _reducer), do: raise "suspension not supported"
  def reduce(_wm, {:halt, {_, acc}}, _reducer), do: {:halted, acc}
  
  def reduce(%WordMatrix{cols: cols, rows: rows, matrix: matrix} = wm, {:cont, {{row, col}, acc}}, reducer) do
    # Position is top-left
    window = matrix
      |> Enum.slice(row..(row + (@window_length - 1)))
      |> Enum.map(fn row -> Enum.slice(row, col..(col + @window_length - 1)) end)
    # Reduce user function
    {tag, acc} = reducer.(window, acc)
    # Pick next location
    continue_col? = col + 1 <= cols - @window_length
    continue_row? = row + 1 <= rows - @window_length
    case {continue_col?, continue_row?} do
      {true, _} -> reduce(wm, {tag, {{row, col + 1}, acc}}, reducer)
      {false, true} -> reduce(wm, {tag, {{row + 1, 0}, acc}}, reducer)
      {false, false} -> {:done, acc}
    end
  end
  def reduce(wm, {:cont, acc}, reducer), do: reduce(wm, {:cont, {{0, 0}, acc}}, reducer)

  @impl true
  def member?(_, _), do: {:error, __MODULE__}

  @impl true
  def slice(_), do: {:error, __MODULE__}
end
```

The input is quite large, but we can break it down:

To spell `XMAS` we need four characters. This can be horizontally, vertically and diagonally. So we're looking at a 4x4 character matrix.

```
XMAS
XMAS
XMAS
XMAS
```

Within that matrix, the number of options for `XMAS` to appear are limitted:

* Four options vertically + Four spelled backwards
* Four options horizontally + Four spelled upsidedown
* Two options diagonally + Two spelled backwards

Thats 20 options in total for our 4x4 matrix.

```elixir
count_word = fn lines ->
  Enum.reduce(lines, 0, fn line, count ->
     case line do
      ~c"XMAS" -> count + 1
      ~c"SAMX" -> count + 1
      _ -> count
    end
  end)
end

horizontal = fn window -> window end

vertical = fn window ->
  Enum.map(0..3, fn col ->
    Enum.reduce(window, [], fn row, list ->
      list ++ [Enum.at(row, col)]
    end)
  end)
end

diagonal = fn window ->
  left_to_right = for i <- 0..3, do: window |> Enum.at(i) |> Enum.at(i)
  right_to_left = for i <- 0..3, do: window |> Enum.at(i) |> Enum.at(3-i)
  [left_to_right, right_to_left]
end

found_count =
  word_matrix
  |> Stream.map(fn window ->
    IO.inspect(window, label: "window")
    h = horizontal.(window) |> count_word.() |> IO.inspect(label: "horizontal")
    v = vertical.(window) |> count_word.() |> IO.inspect(label: "vertical")
    d = diagonal.(window) |> count_word.() |> IO.inspect(label: "diagonal")
    h + v + d
  end)
  #|> Enum.sum() Counts words double, see explaination below...
```

**Problem**: The current solution finds the same word multiple times when it's contained in multiple windows.

When a word is found, I need to write down it's absolute coordinates and not find that same word again next time...

### Ideas

* We don't use a `O(1)` access structure above (lists in Elixir are linked lists)
* ~If we were able to mutate the matrix, we could "scratch out" any found words so that we don't find them again~ that would break future partial matches
* We need a function that given locations in the window for a match returns the global locations for the same match
* We can then store these global location matches in a set and onyl count them once
* Perhaps the notion of using the standard `Iterator` should be thrown out, we need more flexibility

## New Approach

After sleeping on it for another day, I think I have a simpler approach:

* We transform/rotate the whole input
* The result is a list of strings, each string is then simply checked with `substr`/regex for either `XMAS` or `SAMX`
* Horizontal is easy, thats just line by line from the input
* Vertical is the first char of each line, then the second char from each line, etc
* Diagonal left-to-right:
  1. start line 1 char 1
  2. line 2 char 1, line 1 char 2
  3. line 3 char 1, line 2 char 2, line 1 char 3
  4. line 4 char 1, line 3 char 2, line 2 char 3, line 1 char 4
* Diagonal right-to-left:
  1. start line 1 char -1
  2. line 2 char -1, line 1 char -2
  3. line 3 char -1, line 2 char -2, line 1 char -3
  4. line 4 char -1, line 3 char -2, line 2 char -3, line 1 char -4
* No need to keep track of already checked results because we won't seem them again

```elixir
term_regular_regex = ~r/XMAS/
term_reverse_regex = ~r/SAMX/

count_regex_found = fn regex, line ->
  regex |> Regex.scan(line, capture: :first) |> Enum.count()
end

count_terms = fn charlist_line ->
  line = List.to_string(charlist_line)
  regular_count = count_regex_found.(term_regular_regex, line)
  reverse_count = count_regex_found.(term_reverse_regex, line)
  regular_count + reverse_count
end

count_horizontal = fn %WordMatrix{matrix: matrix} ->
  matrix |> Stream.map(count_terms) |> Enum.sum()
end

count_vertical = fn %WordMatrix{matrix: matrix, cols: cols} ->
  Stream.map(0..cols - 1, fn col ->
    for row <- matrix, do: Enum.at(row, col)
  end)
  |> Stream.map(count_terms)
  |> Enum.sum()
end

count_diagonal = fn %WordMatrix{matrix: matrix, rows: rows, cols: cols} ->
  left_to_right = Stream.flat_map(0..rows - 1, fn start ->
    top = for row <- start..0//-1, do: matrix |> Enum.at(row) |> Enum.at(start - row)
    bot = if start < (rows - 1) do
      for col <- start..0//-1, do: matrix |> Enum.at((rows - 1) - (start - col)) |> Enum.at((cols - 1) - col)
    else
      # don't do the middle once in top AND once in bottom!
      []
    end
    [top, bot]
  end)
  right_to_left = Stream.flat_map(0..rows - 1, fn start ->
    top = for row <- start..0//-1, do: matrix |> Enum.at(row) |> Enum.at((cols - 1) - (start - row))
    bot = if start < (rows - 1) do
      for col <- start..0//-1, do: matrix |> Enum.at((rows - 1) - (start - col)) |> Enum.at(col)
    else
      []
    end
    [top, bot]
  end)
   
  [left_to_right, right_to_left]
  |> Stream.zip()
  |> Stream.map(fn {a, b} ->
    count_terms.(a) + count_terms.(b)
  end)
  |> Enum.sum()
end

h = count_horizontal.(word_matrix) |> IO.inspect(label: "h")
v = count_vertical.(word_matrix) |> IO.inspect(label: "v")
d = count_diagonal.(word_matrix) |> IO.inspect(label: "d")
h + v + d
```

## Part 2

* Instead of the word `XMAS`, we're now looking two `MAS` that intersect at the `A`
* By intersecting, they form an X

```
M.S
.A.
M.S
```
